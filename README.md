SQL oprations

This SQL script practices various database operations including bulk and single record insertions, updates, deletions, and selections with conditions in the users table. The most challenging aspect was ensuring proper commenting and organization for clarity and maintainability.

I found some error while deleting first with workbench where safe delete is disabled.
we have to turn off that .

Also creating new column with opratiors is little tricky


For Advance Practice, I learned the concept of getting result from multiple table using joins , using where clause effectively , using group by , having and order , with math oprations as well 
 i found challange of understanding use of the left and right join , 
where it is little compledx to understand , and tricky, but i thing with little practice on dummy data i can comeover of that issue
